    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Nathan Jenkinson. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity at Northern Michigan University, graduating in 2027.</p>
    
    <p>I’m passionate about hands-on learning in information security — from building reproducible workflows and virtualization labs to exploring red team strategies and incident response. My focus is on SOC, MDR, and vendor-side InfoSec roles where I can apply both technical rigor and strategic thinking.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy fishing in Michigan’s inland lakes, experimenting with Linux and Windows setups, and optimizing gaming environments for competitive play. I also like exploring pickup truck modifications and local customization shops.</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to combine technical expertise with practical problem-solving to help organizations strengthen their security posture while continuing to grow my own skills in the field.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to connect with me through the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page!</p>
