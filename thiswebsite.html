    <h1>How I Created This Website</h1>
    <p>This website was built as a personal project to showcase my background and interests. 
       I wanted it to be easy to navigate and a good foundation for learning web development.</p>

    <h2>Steps I Took</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Started with a basic index.html file to serve as the homepage.</li>
      <li>Created additional pages: aboutme.html, contact.html, and thiswebsite.html.</li>
      <li>Added a shared style.css file to keep the design consistent across all pages.</li>
      <li>Built a simple navigation bar with tabs so visitors can move between pages easily.</li>
      <li>Uploaded the files to my GitHub repository and enabled GitHub Pages to host the site.</li>
      <li>Organized assets like images into a dedicated images/ folder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>Through this process, I practiced writing clean HTML and CSS, learned how to structure 
       a multi‑page site.
       It also gave me a chance to connect my cybersecurity background with web development skills.</p>
